## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js 14 with TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS + Framer Motion
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM
- **Authentication**: NextAuth.js with Google OAuth
- **File Storage**: Cloudflare R2
- **Video Player**: React Player
- **Environment**: direnv for auto-loading variables

## 📋 Prerequisites

Before getting started, make sure you have:

- **Node.js** 18+ and npm
- **Docker** (for PostgreSQL database)
- **direnv** (recommended for environment management)
  ```bash
  # macOS
  brew install direnv
  
  # Ubuntu/Debian  
  sudo apt install direnv
  ```

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env.local
   ```

4. Set up direnv for automatic environment loading (if you installed it in prerequisites):
   
   **Add to your shell** (add one of these to your shell config):
   ```bash
   # For Zsh (~/.zshrc)
   eval "$(direnv hook zsh)"
   
   # For Bash (~/.bashrc)
   eval "$(direnv hook bash)"
   ```
   
   **Allow direnv in this project**:
   ```bash
   direnv allow
   ```
   
   Now environment variables will auto-load when you `cd` into the project! 🎉

5. Start the Dockerized database (recommended):
   ```bash
   npm run db:up
   ```

6. Set up the database schema:
   ```bash
   npm run db:push
   ```

7. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

Open [http://localhost:7070](http://localhost:7070) with your browser to see the result.

## 📝 Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file with:

```bash
# Database (Docker default)
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/cinecorner?schema=public"

# NextAuth
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-secret-key-here-change-this-in-production
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:7070

# Google OAuth (get from Google Cloud Console)
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-google-client-id
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-google-client-secret

# Cloudflare R2 (File Storage)
CLOUDFLARE_R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_access_key_id
CLOUDFLARE_R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret_access_key
CLOUDFLARE_R2_BUCKET_NAME=cinecorner-films
CLOUDFLARE_R2_ENDPOINT=https://your-account-id.r2.cloudflarestorage.com
CLOUDFLARE_R2_PUBLIC_URL=https://pub-your-bucket-id.r2.dev

# Next.js
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:7070
```

### 🔄 Auto-Loading with direnv

If you set up direnv (step 4), environment variables will automatically load when you `cd` into the project directory. No need to manually source files or restart your terminal! 

**Benefits:**
- ✅ No more forgetting to load environment variables
- ✅ Works across all terminal sessions
- ✅ Automatically unloads when you leave the project
- ✅ Perfect for team development

## 🐳 Dockerized Database

Quick commands:

```bash
# start database
npm run db:up

# view logs
npm run db:logs

# stop and remove container/volume
npm run db:down
```

The compose file provisions Postgres 16 with a persistent volume `postgres-data`. Default credentials: `postgres:postgres`. The default database is `cinecorner`.
